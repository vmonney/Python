## Warm-up
The warm-up consist of two small tasks. In the first one I fit a logarithmic equation with 50 data points. The second task consist of fitting several models
with data that contains outliers. I fit several linear regressions with different models.

## House Price Prediction.
In the House Price prediction I work on the house prices data set assembled and published by Dean De Cock also available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview).
It's a set of 2,930 observations with 82 attributes each. The goal is to use the first 2,430 ones to fit and evaluate different models 
and use them to make predictions for the last 500 ones. My best model produce a MAE of $13'986 on the test set.
