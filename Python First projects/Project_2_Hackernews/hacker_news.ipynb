    "# Finding the best time and type of posts to receive more comments on Hacker News\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we'll aim to find which type of posts received on average the most comments, as well as at what time to post it on Hacker News. Hacker News is a website where user-submitted stories (known as 'posts') are voted and commented upon, similar to reddit. Hacker News is extremely popular in technology and startup circles, and posts that make it to the top of Hacker News' listings can get hundreds of thousands of visitors as a result.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Introduction\n",
    "We're specifically interested in posts whose titles begin with either Ask HN or Show HN. Users submit \"Ask HN\" posts to ask the Hacker News community a specific question. Likewise, users submit Show HN posts to show the Hacker News community a project, product, or just generally something interesting.\n",
    "Our goal for this project is to analyze data to understand what kinds of posts are likely to produce more comments.\n",
    "\n",
    "the dataset has been reduced from almost 300'00 posts to approximately 20000 posts. We removed all submissions that did not receive any comments, and then randomly sampling from the remaining submissions. Below are descriptions of the columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **id** - The unique identifier from Hacker News for the post\n",
    "- **title** - The title of the post\n",
    "- **url** - The URL that the posts links to, if it the post has a URL\n",
    "- **num_points** - The number of points the post acquired, calculated as the total number of upvotes minus - the total number of downvotes\n",
    "- **num_comments** - The number of comments that were made on the post\n",
    "- **author** - The username of the person who submitted the post\n",
    "- **created_at** - The date and time at which the post was submitted\n",
