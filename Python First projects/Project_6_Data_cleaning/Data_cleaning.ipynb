    "# Clean And Analyze Employee Exit Surveys\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we'll work with exit surveys from employees of the [Department of Education, Training and Employment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Education_and_Training_(Queensland) (DETE) and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) institute in Queensland, Australia. You can find the TAFE exit survey [here](https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-qld-89970a3b-182b-41ea-aea2-6f9f17b5907e/details?q=exit%20survey) and the survey for the DETE [here](https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-qld-fe96ff30-d157-4a81-851d-215f2a0fe26d/details?q=exit%20survey).\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll pretend our stakeholders want to know the following:\n",
    "- Are employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about employees who have been there longer?\n",
    "- Are younger employees resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about older employees?\n",
    "\n",
    "Since a data dictionary wasn't provided with the dataset, we'll use our general knowledge to define the columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a preview of a couple columns we'll work with from the *dete_survey.csv*:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **ID**: An id used to identify the participant of the survey\n",
    "- **SeparationType**: The reason why the person's employment ended\n",
    "- **Cease Date**: The year or month the person's employment ended\n",
    "- **DETE Start Date**: The year the person began employment with the DETE\n",

    "Below is a preview of a couple columns we'll work with from the *tafe_survey.csv*:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Record ID**: An id used to identify the participant of the survey\n",
    "- **Reason for ceasing employment**: The reason why the person's employment ended\n",
    "- **LengthofServiceOverall. Overall Length of Service at Institute (in years)**: The length of the person's employment (in years)\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "we'll start by reading the datasets into pandas and exploring them."
